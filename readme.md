# Spring Boot Rest Chat App

This application is written by Bas Langenberg to teach himself some 'Enterprise' Java and Spring Boot. It's also used to demonstrate the capabilities of Docker, which will be implemented in a later stage of the development.

Feel free to send me ways to improve this if you would like to do this. It's a learning project after all.
